.SH DESCRIPTION
The QHisto file format consists of one or more lines,
each separated by a line feed ('\\n').

.SS Line format
Each line consists of three fields, separated by a tabulator, that
is:

.RS
\fIlabel\fR\\t\fIvalue\fR\\t\fIcolor\fR.
.RE

The fields have the following meaning:
.RS
.TP
.I label
A short description of the value that will be displayed alongside
with it.
.TP
.I value
A number representing of the value. This can be any expression that
converts to a double number; for example: '1.0', '1e10', '-1'.
.TP
.I color
A string specifying a color. This can either be a hexanumerical
identifier prefixed by # or a name. For a full list of supported

.RE

.SS Escaping of special characters
With the exception of the tabulator character and the newline
character, a field may contain any printable character. If a
tabulator character is part of a label, it must be escaped
on write using the two-byte '\\t' notation known from C and
converted back to a tabulator on read.

.SS Encoding
The encoding of a QHisto file is UTF-8.
